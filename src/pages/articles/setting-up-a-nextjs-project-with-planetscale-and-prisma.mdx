## What is PlanetScale?

Planetscale is a technology company that provides a managed database service for running scalable, highly available, and globally distributed databases. Its platform is built on top of the open-source database software, Vitess, and is designed to run on top of Kubernetes. 

Planetscale's managed service simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling distributed databases in the cloud, and is well-suited for applications that require real-time data access and low latency. Its service is built to handle high levels of traffic and provide high availability and fault tolerance.

## What is Prisma?

Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that makes it easy to build high-performance back-ends for modern applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to connect to your database and perform common database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

Prisma works by providing a layer of abstraction over your database. This means that you don't have to worry about writing complex SQL queries or dealing with database-specific syntax.

## Set up a database on PlanetScale

Next, you'll need to set up a database on PlanetScale. If you don't already have a PlanetScale account, you can sign up for a free trial at [PlanetScale](https://www.planetscale.com/).

Once you've signed up and logged in to your account, click on the "Create a database" button in the dashboard. You'll be asked to choose a database type (MySQL or PostgreSQL) and a database name.

After you've chosen your options, click "Create database". This will spin up a new database cluster on PlanetScale, which can take a few minutes.

Once your database is ready, click on the "Connect" button to get the connection details. You'll need these details later when you connect your Prisma schema to the database.

## Setting up Prisma

To get started with Prisma, you'll need to install the Prisma CLI on your development machine. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npm install -g prisma
```

Once the CLI is installed, you can use it to initialize a new Prisma project in your Next.js project by running the following command:

```
prisma init
```

This creates the prisma directory with a file named schema.prisma. This file will hold your Prisma schema configuration, which includes your data sources (PlanetScale), generators (Prisma Client), and data models.

Open up the **prisma/schema.prisma** file and paste in the following:

```js
generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
    previewFeatures = ["referentialIntegrity"]
}

datasource db {
    provider = "mysql"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    referentialIntegrity = "prisma"
}

model Example {
    id String @id @default(cuid())
}
```

## Connect to PlanetScale

To set the Prisma data source, you will need to modify your environment variables. Go to the root directory of your application and open the **.env** file. Replace its current contents with the following:

```js
DATABASE_URL='mysql://<PLANETSCALE_DB_URL>'
```

Now it's time to push your Prisma schema. In a new terminal tab, run the following command:

```js
npx prisma db push
```

## Connecting Prisma to your Next.js project

Once you have your Prisma schema pushed to PlanetScale, you'll need to connect it to your Next.js project. You can do this by installing the @prisma/client package, which provides a JavaScript library for interacting with your Prisma server.

To install the **@prisma/client** package, run the following command:

```
npm install @prisma/client
```

Next, create a new file in your Next.js project called **prisma.js** and add the following code:

```js
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

module.exports = prisma
```

This code creates a new PrismaClient instance and exports it for use in your Next.js project.

## Using Prisma in your Next.js project

For example, you can use the **prisma** object to create a new record in your database like this:

```js
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'John Smith',
    email: 'john@example.com',
  },
})
```

You can also use Prisma to query your database and retrieve data. For example, you can fetch all users in your database or update a users name like this:

```js
const users = await prisma.user.findMany()

const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: 1 },
  data: { name: 'Jane Smith' },
})
```
